<div class="blurb">
	<p>For starters, you already know my name. The first thing I ever wanted to be, for the first four or five years of my life was <em> a pilot.</em> This was way before I actually knew anything about the walk and talk of pilots or the handsome people they are usually around. By the time I went into an airport and boarded an airplane for the first time, I had already decided to be an archaeologist, a historian and a mathematician. Talk about <i>flying</i> through career options!</p>
	<p> I love <u>music</u>, <b>listening</b> to all genres and not only <b>listening</b> but exploring and studying <u>music</u> too. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_81wIHVJYPvS0wNAFttdVY6B2OOEmu0V"; style="color:red;">YouTube playlist</a> I started adding to, in 2016. I will have written a blog post (or more) about my experience with <u>music</u> till I reached some stage of maturity in deciding what I like, by sometime.</p>
	<div style="font-size:23px; line-height:21px;"> In the previous paragraph, you may replace all underlined text by any of the following underlined texts, and replace all bold text by appropriate verbs
	<ul style="font-size:23px; line-height:21px;">
		<li> <u>movies</u> </li>
		<li> <u>books and literature</u> </li>
		<li> <u>fine arts</u> </li>
		<li> <u>history</u> </li>
		<li> <u>mathematics and computer science</u> </li>
	</ul> 
	and the sentences so constructed will still be true. For the sake of completeness, I should mention that I find reading about the history and the making of something particularly interesting about it, so the foregoing list would really be incomplete without mentioning <u>history of everything underlined</u>, which of course, couldn't be included in the list for the sake of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-reference/"; style="color:red;">logical consistency</a>. ;)</div>
	
	<p> When I'm not scouring the Internet looking for new knowledge or for reinforcement of previously scratched surfaces, one can expect me to be watching movies or drawing or typing.</p>
