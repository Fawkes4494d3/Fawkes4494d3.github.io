Well. Finally got around to putting a website of mine together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. I used [this page](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) as a guide, combined with my experience of using Markdown and HTML while writing answers at [MathStackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/). Phew, I'm happy, even though it's 9/11 today :pensive:

Got lots to do. See you in another post.
