It's become almost a reflex to me, from a long time, to say at least something different from the exact thing in my mind. The experiences from my childhood were far too many to even trust my instincts, 
* Can never report the correct taste of what I am tasting and whether something (like *salt*, or spice) needs to be added or controlled. And it feels really, really weird to be myself when everytime I feel it's too salty, everyone else says it's not, and if I feel it could use some more, everyone agrees unanimously that the salt is just right. (you see how that can make one feel salty, eh?)
    * Never have I ever - *got the salt component of the tasting process of food* right. That's one I can never drink too.
    * Now that I think about it, maybe I don't taste food at all, except if it is extremely good or extremely bad. I just gobble till I can take it. That doesn't even require tasting.
* Digressed, did I? Okay, okay, so ... here's a thing. Here's a poem for you to read and see what you find interesting:
