It's become almost a reflex to me, from a long time, to say at least something different from the exact thing in my mind. The experiences from my childhood were far too many to even trust my instincts, 
* Can never report the correct taste of what I am tasting and whether something (like *salt*, or spice) needs to be added or controlled. And it feels really, really weird to be myself when everytime I feel it's too salty, everyone else says it's not, and if I feel it could use some more, everyone agrees unanimously that the salt is just right. (you see how that can make one feel salty, eh?)
    * Never have I ever - *got the salt component of the tasting process of food* right. That's one I can never drink too.
    * Now that I think about it, maybe I don't taste food at all, except if it is extremely good or extremely bad. I just gobble till I can take it. That doesn't even require tasting.
* Digressed, did I? Okay, okay, so ... here's a thing. Here's a poem for you to read and see what you find interesting: 
> Sometimes [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) [sleep](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWTBaQvn-qn/), [dreaming with](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDTUStgsXn6/) a [dusty eye](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPMwH7CDE_O/) <br>
> Your [eyes](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDOABD4s4zl/) are [fish](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFzS2xvsxOE/), they [don't see](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDDoHOvM_z2/) the [same things](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFbVlTMMPkS/) as I <br>
> You call [a palace](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCu2xxYs4ig/), y'know [sole treasures](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFHxOAOs05P/) it can hold <br>
> And [palace-remarkable](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEWYGFkMa3L/) [need not be](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6zMqIlAnz7/) made of gold <br>
> The [outside](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8ukt7hgwtk/) and [inside](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCnlzL4syR9/) might have no [likeliness](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8buII3gDjG/) far or near <br>
> [Ink spilt outside](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCgTS7hMmWH/) is [absorbed](https://www.instagram.com/p/CF2CeC7Mm2Z/) by [your inners](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGzffqxMldd/) <br>
> [Drooled](https://www.instagram.com/p/BoquDWWBtWe/) [on the paper](https://fawkes4494d3.github.io/himars/) through ink, it's [poison yours](https://www.instagram.com/p/Boejq9BhvSj/) <br>
> Truly [you are](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_SF9jfgTz0/), bright; dangerous - a [self-potrait](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_SF9jfgTz0/) of yours, <br>
> More than a portrait is [of your self](https://www.instagram.com/p/B0RyBqQg--E/). <br>
> Giving birth to [spontaneity](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_pwQuugDcA/), dancing as you go <br>
> I'd like to see, close times, [us together grow](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBqMNAVMuSH/).

And finally, [here's a link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_81wIHVJYPvrNGDfDDEr42t5h3CXzAPi) to a playlist I made for you, smaller in size than I had hoped it to be due to change of plans (more on this later, with a theme of reversal working throughout ;) ), but hopefully with good music.

Each of those words above is a link. Go on, click on any one of them to know more about what this could be and who "you" is.
If this you, Mars, you know what to do. I love you.
