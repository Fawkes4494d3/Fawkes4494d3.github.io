			<p> Hiii, and soooo, you found the clue for today. I am not sure there are going to be too many clues like that (make sure there aren't ;) ), totally depends on how many ideas I can really come up with, because HTML, CSS are turning out to be extremely efficient beasts.</p>
			<p> Since, you are here already, I will tell you why such a random password, but to find out the answer, which you will love, of course, really make sure there's nothing hidden on this page. :P </p>
			<p> I apologize for the poor display, but this is really the best version of a reverse-surprise I could put up. </p>
			<p> Reversing the surprise was a very conscious decision, and to be honest, it's been kind of interesting, and stress-tested my patience at it. XD <br>
				I had never honestly thought that it would be this much of fun while learning. 
				<ul>
					<li> I learnt that with HTML you can only construct static pages, unlike the webpages one can usually interact on, like the google search page or the facebook page. </li>
					<li> There's still a lot to be learnt about HTML and how far you can go before reaching its limits. You can animate and even do actions with if-else conditions in HTML. </li>
					<li> It is at the step of processing that HTML puts its limbs up and throws the tantrum, "Now you guys need to find a new language - you are exploiting the hell out of me; good old CSS and ME". </li>
					<li> HTML5 is like, "I may be young but now I need to take care of my great-great-grandparent, HTML" while CSS3 is stuck with a technologically challenged grandfather. </li>
					<li> Among them suddenly comes a student, almost a Sharmaji ka beta, gone done his studies in Cambridge this boy, introduces himself as JS. </li>
					<li> Now JavaScript is cool and all, definitely much cooler than blood-cold uncle Python, at least that's what HTML and CSS think, they can relate to JS a lot. </li>
					<li> So much so that sometimes when headmaster Python comes for a visit, even his shoes stand out quite prominently while friend JS easily fits into scripted HTML-CSS discussions without anybody even noticing. </li>
				</ul>
				and I realized, reversing a surprise is much harder than actually engineering the forward one. For one
				<ul>
					<li> You kind of know what to expect, which of course, is crucial in this case, since you do not like surprises </li>
					<li> And that makes it harder on my intellectual faculties, which do nothing to help one btw, if they are not duly exercised. </li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<script>
				function tohide(c) {
				  var y = "mydiv";
				  var name = y.concat(c);
				  var x = document.getElementById(name);
				  if (x.style.display === "none") {
				    x.style.display = "block";
				  } else {
				    x.style.display = "none";
				  }
				} 
			</script>
			<p> So the decision was quite challenging per se, and there was a good many number of things I planned a number of different times and the crystal clear implication of having to work hard to realise any one of them made me welcome this reversal as a challenge. Also it was becoming really really necessary to show you at least something that I had been up to, to again let you into my life, which I had forgotten to do so, so far and was going on sucking badly at. <br> 
				This, on the other hand is also one chance I am getting to redeem myself, and the chance to have more chances, to regain as many pieces of your faith in me which I have broken as I can. :P
				So here's the following list for the other things that I had planned but ended up having not met in the foregoing days, in no particular order ... :
				<ul>
					<li> <button onclick="tohide('1')">This is the first one</button>
						<div id="mydiv1" style="display: none;">  Thought I would start with wishing (as in starting this reversal process) from the 9<sup>th</sup> of this month. That would have given me 12 days consecutive, in which I would have called you at special times, like 1:23, or 12:34 or 3:33, maybe even align these times with the countdown index, with calling between 12pm and 1pm on the first day, and between 1pm and 2pm on the second day, so that on the 12<sup>th</sup> day, which would be the 20<sup>th</sup> of November, I would call in between 12am and 1am, which would precisely be at 12am. You can obviously see so many things that could go wrong in this one, what with the timings, I had even decided to maintain a 12 minutes 34 seconds, or 33 minutes 33 seconds long phone calls, and I would have asked you on the 20<sup>th</sup> midnight when I called you to go check the call logs over the last 12 days. 12 days for 12 distinct hours in a day, for 12 sons of David and 12 prophets chosen by cheeses himself. (David, of course, is not that guy from the Bible. David Schitt could be a suitable boy.)</div>
					</li>
					<li> <button onclick="tohide('2')">This is another one</button>
						<div id="mydiv2" style="display: none;"> Thought it would be awesome if I could actually learn to play a little something on the synth while I sing it, using what little vocal gifts I have :3 , <br>
						and started learning a song, the vocal part of it, and have almost given up now, because you sing better than me anyday. I still practice though, only in the bathroom. If so be it, I shall become the sloppy nightingale of my own rain. B)</div>
					</li>
					<li> <button onclick="tohide('3')">Another one?</button>
						<div id="mydiv3" style="display: none;"> Goddamnit, you should try to be prepared for some surprises! ;)</div>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				As a friendly reminder again, ;) check for anything you can find up here, as a clue, from the very <strong>top</strong> to <strong>bottom</strong>. I have banked on your curiosity.
