				<p> Now, there's quite a few likely ways you arrived up here. In any of those cases, you would definitely have had to click on the <strong>Why?!</strong> part
					in the dropdown for the hidden "CV" label in the navigator above. So, you know that trick. But I had set up quite a few paths to reach here, in there,
					including a path when you didn't come across the game with the lights at all. So here's a couple of things I had promised: (<u>click on the button to show or hide, it can do both</u>)
					<ul>
						<li> <button onclick="tohide('1')">Remember this one? No surprises - promise!</button>
						<div id="mydiv1" style="display: none;">  
							Remember that coding problem with bulbs and something, you had asked me to tell you if I found out an algorithm to that problem finally.
							Well, I had done indeed, it was not so tough. What seemed tougher was actually implementing it. Check it out <a href="feelhot.html">here</a>.
							There's a 45 second time limit on it for today (after 45 seconds the page gets redirected to another page, where you get yet another
							chance to go back to the previous page) and I will implement a button to set the number of seconds the page waits for you sometime soon. ;) 
						</div>
						</li>
						
						<li> <button onclick="tohide('2')">That numberphile promise</button>
						<div id="mydiv2" style="display: none;">  
							Hopefully, you have read <a href="index.html">this post</a>. In the last list of things there, I have mentioned that thing I wanted to do 
							with numbers, and would have required 12 days for it to work out, but then, today is the 10<sup>th</sup> day before your birthday, and any countdown
							(except for spaceships going to the moon, or Mars) begins with 10. Seems like 10 is not necessarily so bad either. So here's my quip:
							<ul>
								
								<li> If I had indeed followed on with the plan for 12 days, I would have tried to finish the list of all the hour:minute timings in the days
									as I had promised once, and I will. </li>
								<li> <u>How many minutes is that?</u> 60 minutes an hour times 24 hours a day gives 1440 minutes, so in 12 days, I would have had to do 120 
									numbers per day. But now, with 10 days, if I were to do all of them, I would need to make an average of 144. So I will list a number 
									of nice properties about 144. But before that, another small quip, <b><i><u>boiling the whole haphazard planning down to the number 
									144 is precisely the</u></i></b> wait-for-it <b><u>reversal of the Butterfly Effect</u></b> in our relationship, we went from 
									<ul>
										<li> me impressing you with seemingly magical single-digit-tricks ... <u> to </u> </li>
										<li> those tricks dying out with monotonicity and overusage ... <u> to </u> </li>
										<li> feeling the need to have to go to 
											should-be-otherwise unnecessary bounds to make something sound 
											magical again </li>
									</ul>
									the tour-de-force with the butterfly effect has been strong. <br>
									Here, I try to win your trust back by reminding you that I am just stuck, not satisfied, and go
									through the processes in the above list, in the <i>reverse</i> order, finding order from chaos in the
									domino effect caused so far. </li>
								<li> So 144 it is.
									<ul>
										<li> 144 is composed of 3 individually-perfect-square digits, 1,4 and 4 </li>
										<li> Is a perfect square itself, as is it's <i>reverse</i> 441. </li>
										<li> Sum of it's digits=S(144)=1+4+4=9 and product of it's digits=P(144)=1*4*4=16 are also perfect squares</li>
										<li> S(144)=3<sup>2</sup> and P(144)=4<sup>2</sup>, and <br> 
											144=12<sup>2</sup>=(3*4)<sup>2</sup>=3<sup>2</sup>4<sup>2</sup>=S(144)*P(144) <br>
											so 144 is the product of the sum of it's digits and the product of it's digits. </li>
										<li> 144 is 12 many 12s, the significant number mentioned in my <a href="index.html">previous
											post</a>, appearing in many theological contexts (of course XD) </li>
										<li> A property which sounds quite fun to state as I ponder over it is: <br>
											sum of any n<sup>th</sup> powers of the digits of 144 is divisible by 3 <br>
											i.e. 1<sup>n</sup>+4<sup>n</sup>+4<sup>n</sup> is divisible by 3 for any whole number n. </li>
									</ul></li>

				  <p>Now, here's why that password. Initially it sounded like 'thesis' to me, and I was almost unsure of what the word would actually
					  sound like for a second, it is actually just 'this is' put together. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7Q8ue9kBM">This is the last of .....</a> </p>

				  <p> That's it for today, I think and I hope I am able to live up to whatever I have promised to myself, in the coming days. <br>
					  Hope we meet soon. Bye, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">love</a>. </p>
