          Imma have a conversation with you today. We can do this on a long text that this one can be, like a letter, eh?
          <br> <br>
          Why this password?. <em>Will put a password explanation here with another link</em>

          It's not difficult to find something that you would like. You're one more collection of cells like me, accepting anything that comes their way to enlighten their life. I wouldn't trust the aging and comprehension skills of the sentient part of our cells to be the same, because they are so obviously not.

          Strangers in the night//Exchanging glances//Wondering in the night//What were the chances//We'd be sharing love//Before the night was through?//Something in your eyes//Was so inviting//Something in your smile//Was so exciting//Something in my heart told me I must have you (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXJysyMVTsQ"> learn </a>)

          what is the probability of little baby learning probability? I said <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p%20\in%20(0.5,1)">. Prove it using the direct conditional probability calculations shown in the wikipedia page for the monty hall problem.
